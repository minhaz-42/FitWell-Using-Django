# Notes:
# - `transformers[torch]` will attempt to install a compatible `torch` build. For
#   Macs without CUDA, you may prefer installing the CPU-only wheel directly, e.g.: 
#   `pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu`
# - Large models require significant disk space and RAM; ensure you have resources
#   before trying to load big checkpoints locally.
